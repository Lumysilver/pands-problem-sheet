# I have researched the topic and I have came across some valuable sources, such as: https://www.delftstack.com/howto/python/python-datetime-day-of-week/#:~:text=of%20the%20day.-,Use%20the%20weekday()%20Method%20to%20Get%20the%20Name%20of,0%20and%20Sunday%20is%206.

import datetime

#I am going to give to each weekday the return message which will be displayed when the program starts
